## Programming Assignment Eight
### Using MySQL with PHP

The purpose of this assignment is for the student to learn to link together MySQL and PHP.

In the previous assignment you used the MySQL command line to create a warehouse and employee table. You also used the command line to add new records and select records. Now you will learn to do those operations from inside a PHP script.

In the lecture notes on MySQL and PHP you will notice that the final example has the screenshot, but the code is missing. Your assignment is to write the code for the fourth example.

Copy my code for the dbtest3.php script to create your HW08.php script. First, modify the code so that it connects to your database. You probably also need to change the spelling or capitalization of field names in my PHP code to match your database setup.

After you get your new script to add records to your database, then add the code necessary to delete records that are selected by the user.
