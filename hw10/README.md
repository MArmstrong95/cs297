## CSCI 297 Homework 10
### Scheduling Tool 2.1
### Student Functions with MySQL

The student should be able to perform these functions:

- select an appointment time
  - be sure to remove that time so that no other student can select it
  - provide a nice message (suitable for saving) that states their name and their appointment time
- look for their appointment
  - students forget which time they selected, so provide them with a search function
