## Homework Seven
### Working With MySQL

The purpose of this assignment is to get you up and running on Winthrop's MySQL server.

**Step One:** Go through the tutorial written by Dr. Foster and execute each of the commands. (But don't execute the commands in section V that create a new database. That is optional.) When you are done with that brief tutorial you will have two tables, warehouse and employee, that you can use to complete the next step.

**Step Two:** Create a batch file that performs the following actions:

- add one new warehouse
- add five new employees (have just two employees earn over $25,000)
- show the contents of the warehouse table
- show the contents of the employee table
- list the employee number of each employee making $20,000
- which cities have employees making over $25,000
- what is the total payroll of the charlotte warehouse
